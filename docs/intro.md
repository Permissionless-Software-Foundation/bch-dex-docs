# Introduction

[bch-dex](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-dex) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) for trading [SLP tokens](https://github.com/simpleledger/slp-specifications/blob/master/slp-token-type-1.md) on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain. Forks of bch-dex are currently being built for the eCash (XEC) and Avalanche X-Chain (AVAX) blockchains. These DEXs will be complimented by cross-chain bridges, allowing easy, low-friction, low-cost movement of value across blockchains and token ecosystems.

`bch-dex` is intended to be operated on a [Raspberry Pi 400](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-400/) minicomputer, but it can also be operated on a standard PC running Ubuntu Linux. The software operates best when always running and connected to the internet, and the Raspberry Pi makes a perfect low-power appliance. The device can be controlled via a web browser from any other computer in your home network.

`bch-dex` operates as an extension of the Bitcoin protocol. That means there is no '.com' website that can be blocked, no account that can shut down, and no government ID required to use it. It's a peer-to-peer protocol, just like Bitcoin. When you trade, there are only two parties. There is no intermediary. And no one can stop you from running the software in the comfort of your own home.
