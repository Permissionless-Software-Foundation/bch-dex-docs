# Desktop PC Setup

It's also possible to run `bch-dex` software on a desktop PC running Ubuntu Linux. The recommended hardware is:
- 32 GB of RAM
- 1 TB SSD hard drive
- Ubuntu 20.04+

This hardware will not only let you run all the `bch-dex` software, you'll be able to run on the 'Global Back End' infrastructure described at [CashStack.info](https://cashstack.info), allowing you to be fully self-sufficient, with no dependency on any third party.
