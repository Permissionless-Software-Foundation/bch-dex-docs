# Raspberry Pi Setup

Before installing the software, you must setup your hardware device. The target operating to run the `bch-dex` software is Ubuntu Linux. An SD card of 64GB or bigger is recommended. Using a USB 3.0 hard drive is even better than an SD card, but this requires a firmware update to the Raspberry Pi.
